One similarity between python and scratch is being able to create functions and define them.  Also, you can set coordinates the same way you do in scratch, just by typing.  One difference is the way you switch pen colors because you can use hex colors or type in the color.  Also, creating loops is different in Python than in scratch because it's written as "range".  Debugging our program was fun and difficult because it was really rewarding being able to fix our program.  We struggled with creating a function and figuring out how to change the pen color.
