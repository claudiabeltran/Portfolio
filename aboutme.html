<p>One similarity between python and scratch is being able to create functions and define them.  Also, you can set coordinates the same way you do in scratch, just by typing.  One difference is the way you switch pen colors because you can use hex colors or type in the color.  Also, creating loops is different in Python than in scratch because it's written as "range".  Debugging our program was fun and difficult because it was really rewarding being able to fix our program.  We struggled with creating a function and figuring out how to change the pen color.

<p> Today went really well.  We had alot of fun making our program.  I think I like using Python more than using Scratch because it's easier
  to make changes and see what you did wrong. </p>

<p> A list is a collection of data and adding a list is really helpful when making an application because it puts all your data in one 
  place and you can easily access specific data points by adding other functions.  I worked in the same group all day and I really liked 
  working with my partners because we all helped eachother when we had problems and it was nice to bounce ideas off eachother.
  The project that we worked on today was probably the hardest one we've done so far for me because it introduced a new topic that I
  knew nothing about: pixels.  However, it was really rewarding once we got through all our problems and finished the project. </p>
