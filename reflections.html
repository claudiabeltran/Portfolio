   <h2>7/17/17</h2>
<p>One similarity between python and scratch is being able to create functions and define them.  Also, you can set coordinates the same way you do in scratch, just by typing.  One difference is the way you switch pen colors because you can use hex colors or type in the color.  Also, creating loops is different in Python than in scratch because it's written as "range".  Debugging our program was fun and difficult because it was really rewarding being able to fix our program.  We struggled with creating a function and figuring out how to change the pen color. 
    <h2>7/18/17</h2>
<p> Today went really well.  We had alot of fun making our program.  I think I like using Python more than using Scratch because it's easier
  to make changes and see what you did wrong. </p>
    <h2>7/19/17</h2>
<p> A list is a collection of data and adding a list is really helpful when making an application because it puts all your data in one 
  place and you can easily access specific data points by adding other functions.  I worked in the same group all day and I really liked 
  working with my partners because we all helped eachother when we had problems and it was nice to bounce ideas off eachother.
  The project that we worked on today was probably the hardest one we've done so far for me because it introduced a new topic that I
  knew nothing about: pixels.  However, it was really rewarding once we got through all our problems and finished the project. </p>
    <h2>7/20/17</h2>
<p> Visiting Refinery29 was a really fun and rewarding experience because we learned about a couple of different career paths under a 
  magazine company.  Also, it was a nice experience to pitch our ideas because it taught us a skill that we might need to use in the future.
  If I could have changed one thing about the trip I would've liked to spend more time talking about how we could actually make our ideas 
  happen. But overall I really enjoyed visiting because the environment was really cool and I learned a lot. </p>
    <h2>7/25/17</h2>
<p> Figuring out how to make the photocell work with the LED was probably the hardest challenge we've done yet because my group didn't
  communicate or work together very well.  I think it would've been helpful if we'd assigned jobs to eachother from the beginning because
  not all of us got to work on the project as much as we could have. However, I think this challenge taught me a lot about working in 
  groups and I'll try to use this experience to make groupwork better next time.  Although we did well on working through our problems and making
  sure that everyone understood what we were doing. </p>
    <h2>7/26/17</h2>
<p> Today when we worked on making the robot dance and sing, my group struggled with the same problem as yesterday which was communicating
  with eachother.  The work wasn't divided equally and not everyone got to work or understand all aspects of creating the robot.
  However, I learned many new ways that the robot and the Arduino can be used.  At the beginning of the project, I didn't know that we
  could make the Arduino play music or use it to control the wheel's movements, but now I understand it more.</p>
    <h2>7/27/17</h2>
<p> I really enjoyed making the robot move based on the push button.  It was really satisfying being able to finally figure out how to make it move.
 We named the robot Bekky, with two k's, and I can't wait to work on making her dodge obstacles tomorrow.  A glow for our group is that the work was
  more equally divided between the group so I think we did well on that.  A grow is that we could still work better on communicating
  with the whole group because half of us work really well together and the other half not as well.</p>
